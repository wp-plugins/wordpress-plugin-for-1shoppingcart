Using shortcodes, you can easily display product details from your 1ShoppingCart.com product catalog on pages or posts within your Wordpress site.

== Description ==

Are you tired of having to enter your product details twice - once into 1ShoppingCart.com and then again in your Wordpress website? The [Free Wordpress Plugin For 1ShoppingCart](http://www.equalserving.com/products-page/wordpress-plugin/free-wordpress-plugin-for-1shoppingcart/ "Free Wordpress Plugin For 1ShoppingCart") is the solution for you.

Using shortcodes, you can easily display product details from your 1ShoppingCart.com product catalog on pages or posts within your Wordpress site. All that needs to be entered on the page or post is the title and the shortcut code [es1sc_prodlist]. The shortcode [es1sc_prodlist] without any additional arguments will display your entire active product catalog. You can limit the list to specific products by adding the argument prd_ids to the shortcode such as -
[es1sc_prodlist prd_ids="8644152,8644145,8580674,8569588,8569508,8361626"].

The plugin uses the 1ShoppingCart.com API. Since you enter what products are on sale along with the sale price into the 1ShoppingCart.com interface, the API knows which products are on sale and displays the proper price.

Unfortunately, because Bundled Offers are not really products, the API does not support any bundled offers that are in the catalog. Bundled products would have to be maintained manually on the Wordpress site.

== Installation ==

Upload the Free Wordpress Plugin For 1ShoppingCart.com plugin to your blog, Activate it, then enter your 1ShoppingCart.com API settings on the Settings -> 1SC Settings page.

That's it! You're done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The product display is not very pleasing.  How can I easily improve it? =

Surround the shortcode in a div tag such as - 

<div id="product_catalog">
<h2>Featured Products</h2>
[es1sc_prodlist prd_ids="8644152,8644145,8580674,8569588,8569508,8361626"]
</div>

or 

<div id="product_catalog">
<h2>All Products</h2>
[es1sc_prodlist]
</div>

Then add the following to your theme's stylesheet.

#product_catalog h2 {color: #FF4D00; font-size: 2em; line-height: 2.2em; margin: 5px 0; }
#product_catalog div.product {border-bottom: 1px dotted #FF9900;clear: both;font-size: 12px; padding: 5px 0;}
#product_catalog .product .product_name {text-align: left; ; display:block; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.4em;}
#product_catalog div.product img.product_image {float: left; padding: 5px 5px 5px 0; width: 125px; }
#product_catalog div.product .product_details {text-align: right; display:block;}
#product_catalog div.product .product_details .description {text-align: left; font-size: 1.2em; display: block;}
#product_catalog div.product .price {font-weight: bold; display: block;}
#product_catalog div.product .product_details .sku {text-align: left; font-size: 0.85em; display: block;}
#product_catalog div.product .product_details .buy-now {display: block; padding: 0 0 8px 0;}
